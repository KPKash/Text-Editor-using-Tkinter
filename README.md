# Text-Editor-using-Tkinter

This Python code is for text editor application using the tkinter library. It allows users to create, open, save, and edit text files. The editor includes basic formatting options like bold and italics, as well as features to change text and background colors.

The code starts by importing necessary modules from tkinter to create the GUI elements. A main window is created and configured with the title "Winter live Project". Inside the window, a text box is placed where users can enter and edit their text. Scrollbars are added for both horizontal and vertical scrolling.

A menu bar is created with three menus: File, Edit, and Colors. The File menu offers options to create new files, open existing ones, save changes, and exit the application. The Edit menu includes commands for cutting, copying, pasting, undoing, redoing, selecting all text, and clearing the text box. The Colors menu allows users to change the color of selected text, all text, or the background color.

A toolbar is placed at the top of the window with buttons for common actions. These buttons include bold and italics formatting, undo and redo, and changing the color of selected text.

A status bar is displayed at the bottom of the window to provide information to the user, such as the current file name or status messages.

The code binds keyboard shortcuts to common actions for convenience. For example, Ctrl+C is used for copying selected text.

Overall, this Python code provides a basic text editor with essential features for creating and editing text documents.
